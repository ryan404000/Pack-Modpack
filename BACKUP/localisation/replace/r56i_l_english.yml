#Events
 
 #People are unhappy
 r56i.event.01.title:0 "Riots in the Streets"
 r56i.event.01.description:0 "It seems the public has been ignored for a bit too long. Angered by the current situation and unable to take anymore, violence has erupted. While their demands are fairly moderate, they are certainly costly."
 r56i.event.01.default:0 "Most disturbing."
 r56i.event.01.democratic:0 "Our citizens are suffering."
 r56i.event.01.communism:0 "Our brothers are being manipulated."
 r56i.event.01.fascism:0 "The people must be given a strong hand."
 
 #People are unhappy again
 r56i.event.02.title:0 "The Riots Return"
 r56i.event.02.description:0 "The riots are still ongoing, and have taken a turn for the worse. More intellectuals from our society are supporting them, and demands originally seen as extreme are being demanded far more often."
 r56i.event.02.default:0 "What can we do?"
 r56i.event.02.democratic:0 "Surely there must be a solution?"
 r56i.event.02.communism:0 "These are not true Communists!"
 r56i.event.02.fascism:0 "Perhaps extreme measures are required."
 
 #Violent suppression is a success
 r56i.event.04.title:0 "Crackdown is a Success"
 r56i.event.04.description:0 "While the discontent may still be hold their beliefs, they've learned the hard way to keep their ideas private. Though unease lingers in the air, the riot and military police have broken up the protests, and the people have returned to their normal lives."
 r56i.event.04.default:0 "A few broken eggs."
 r56i.event.04.democratic:0 "And remember- vote for us!"
 r56i.event.04.communism:0 "The cost of the revolution is high."
 r56i.event.04.fascism:0 "Let the weaklings tremble."
 
 #Violent suppression is a failure
 r56i.event.05.title:0 "Crackdown is a Failure"
 r56i.event.05.description:0 "Though the Military Police we sent at the riots could theoretically restore order, several of our men dispatched to deal with the situation actually started joining the riots. The few who stayed loyal seem to have only angered the rest of the public. It seems we have only added more few to the fire."
 r56i.event.05.default:0 "What do we pay them for?"
 r56i.event.05.democratic:0 "We have betrayed our values for nothing."
 r56i.event.05.communism:0 "They must be getting help from outside."
 r56i.event.05.fascism:0 "We should send the REAL military next time."
 
 #Talk suppression is a success
 r56i.event.06.title:0 "Talks Succeed"
 r56i.event.06.description:0 "Just like any other human, a protest organizer is fallible. Vague, empty promises were enough to placate some of the leaders, while others had to be paid off with... donations for peace efforts from the state treasury. Regardless, with no more organization, the protests seem to have burned themselves out."
 r56i.event.06.default:0 "The pen is mighty."
 r56i.event.06.democratic:0 "Democracy prevails again."
 r56i.event.06.communism:0 "The dialectic serves us well."
 r56i.event.06.fascism:0 "The masses are easily appeased."
 
 #Talk suppresion is a failure
 r56i.event.07.title:0 "Talks Fail"
 r56i.event.07.description:0 "It turns out it's a lot easier to talk one person down than a group- a lesson our Interior Minister has learned after attempting to convince all major protest leaders to disband. With some not believing out promises, and others disgusted by our bribery attempts, we seem to have only sown unity and cohesion between riot leaders."
 r56i.event.07.default:0 "Why can't they be non-aligned, like us?"
 r56i.event.07.democratic:0 "This is an insult to our Democracy."
 r56i.event.07.communism:0 "But our state can provide all!"
 r56i.event.07.fascism:0 "Well, we tried being nice about it."
 
 #Spend suppression is a success
 r56i.event.08.title:0 "Rioters Appeased"
 r56i.event.08.description:0 "Though the cost was high, now that the potholes in our city streets are filled and the social programs have shown a bit of an improvement, the people are happy enough to end the organized riots. Some are still complaining, but most are satisfied."
 r56i.event.08.default:0 "Well, if they're happy..."
 r56i.event.08.democratic:0 "Money makes the world go 'round."
 r56i.event.08.communism:0 "Capital still has some uses."
 r56i.event.08.fascism:0 "The sheep were never a threat."
 
 #Spend suppression is a failure
 r56i.event.09.title:0 "Rioters Demand More"
 r56i.event.09.description:0 "Despite having filled the original demands of the protest leaders, more extreme figures have taken over and have started to demand even more from our state- and the people, now emboldened by perceived victory, are more willing to follow their every word."
 r56i.event.09.default:0 "A waste of valuable funds."
 r56i.event.09.democratic:0 "Spoiled rotten Socialists."
 r56i.event.09.communism:0 "That forced labor was a waste!"
 r56i.event.09.fascism:0 "How DARE they insult our great nation so?"

 #Strikes planners are found out

 strikes_rt56.t:0 "Workers Planning Strikes Arrested"
 strikes_rt56.desc:0 "Goverment law enforcement has recently uncovered a plan by workers in many factories around the country to strike. Luckily the plan was found out and the ring leaders were arrested. Hopefully this will prevent any production interruptions."
