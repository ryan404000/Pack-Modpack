sp_eng_chamberlain_peace_in_our_time_desc:0 ""This morning I had another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine. Some of you, perhaps, have already heard what it contains but I would just like to read it to you: "We, the German Führer and Chancelor, and the British Prime Minister, have had a further meeting today and are agreed in recognizing that the question of anglo-german relations is of the first importance for the two countries and for Europe. We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again."\nNeville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, 30/09/1938, Heastone Aerodrome, London"
sp_eng_chamberlain_declaration_of_war:0 "Declaration of War |3:00"
sp_eng_chamberlain_declaration_of_war_desc:0 ""I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing St. This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that, unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more, or anything different, that I could have done, and that would have been more successful. Up to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland. But Hitler would not have it; he had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened. And although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement. The proposals were never shown to the Poles, nor to us. And though they were announced in the German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning. His action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today in fulfillment of our obligations going to the aid of Poland who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience, we have done all that any country could do to establish peace, but a situation in which no word given by Germany's ruler could be trusted, and no people or country could feel itself safe, had become intolerable. And now that we have resolved to finish it, I know that you will all play your parts with calmness and courage."\nNeville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, 03/09/1939, Cabinet Room, 10 Downing Street, London, United Kingdom"

sp_eng_we_shall_fight_on_the_beaches_desc:0 ""We are told that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the British Isles. |...| I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."\nSir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, 04/06/1940, House of Commons, London, United Kingdom"
sp_eng_this_was_their_finest_hour:0 "This was their Finest Hour |3:11"
sp_eng_this_was_their_finest_hour_desc:0 ""We do not yet know what will happen in France or whether the French resistance will be prolonged, both in France and in the French Empire overseas. The French Government will be throwing away great opportunities and casting away their future if they do not continue the war in accordance with their Treaty obligations, from which we have not felt able to release them. The House will have read the historic declaration in which, at the desire of many Frenchmen, and of our own hearts, we have proclaimed our willingness to conclude at the darkest hour in French history a union of common citizenship. However matters may go in France or with the French Government or with another French Government, we in this island and in the British Empire will never lose our sense of comradeship with the French people. If we are now called upon to endure what they have suffered we shall emulate their courage, and if final victory rewards our toils they shall share the gains, aye. And freedom shall be restored to all. We abate nothing of our just demands—Czechs, Poles, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians, all who have joined their causes to our own shall be restored. What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilisation. Upon it depends our own British life and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him all Europe may be free, and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands; but if we fail then the whole world, including the United States, and all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister, and perhaps more prolonged, by the lights of a perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves that if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years men will still say, "This was their finest hour."

This I do with all my heart. You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne. But I want you to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country or the empire, which, as Prince of Wales, and lately as King, I have for 25 years tried to serve. But you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love."\nKing Edward VIII, Prince of the United Kingdom, 12/12/1936, Windsor Castle, Berkshire, United Kingdom"

The service rendered by Finland to mankind is magnificent. They have exposed, for all the world to see, the military incapacity of the Red Army and of the Red Air Force. Many illusions about Soviet Russia have been dispelled in these few fierce weeks of fighting in the Arctic Circle. Everyone can see how Communism rots the soul of a nation; how it makes it abject and hungry in peace, and proves it base and abominable in war. |...| If the light of freedom which still burns so brightly in the frozen North should be finally quenched, it might well herald a return to the Dark Ages, when every vestige of human progress during two thousand years would be engulfed."\nSir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of The United Kingdom, 20/01/1940, House of Many Mansions, London, United Kingdom"

sp_eng_churchill_the_end_of_the_beginning_desc:0 ""We have got so far in this war taken as many German prisoners as they have taken British, but these German prisoners will no doubt come in in droves at the end just as they did last time. I have never promised anything but blood, tears, toil and sweat. Now, however, we have a new experience. We have victory-a remarkable and definite victory. The bright gleam has caught the helmets of our soldiers and warmed and cheered all our hearts. The late M.Venizelos observed that in all her wars England-he ought to have said Britain, of course-always wins one battle-the last. General Alexander, with his brilliant comrade and lieutenant, General Montgomery, has made a glorious and decisive victory in what I think should be called the Battle of Egypt. Rommel's army has been defeated. It has been routed. It has been very largely destroyed as a fighting force. |...| Now, this is not the end. It is not even the beginning to the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."\nSir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, 10/11/1942, Mansion House, London, United Kingdom"

sp_eng_blood_toil_tears_and_sweat_desc:0 ""I would say to the House, as I said to those who've joined this government: "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat." We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: victory. Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival. Let that be realised; no survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge and impulse of the ages, that mankind will move forward towards its goal. But I take up my task with buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men. At this time I feel entitled to claim the aid of all, and I say, "Come then, let us go forward together with our united strength."

Is it possible that they do not realize that we shall never cease to persevere against them until they have been taught a lesson which they and the world will never forget? Members of the Senate, and members of the House of Representatives, I will turn for one moment more from the turmoil and convulsions of the present to the broader spaces of the future. Here we are together, facing a group of mighty foes who seek our ruin. Here we are together, defending all that to free men is dear. Twice in a single generation the catastrophe of world war has fallen upon us. Twice in our lifetime has the long arm of fate reached out across the oceans to bring the United States into the forefront of the battle. If we had kept together after the last war, if we had taken common measures for our safety, this renewal of the curse need never have fallen upon us. Do we not owe it to ourselves, to our children, to tormented mankind, to make sure that these catastrophes do not engulf us for the third time? It has been proved that pestilences may break out in the Old World which carry their destructive ravages into the New World, from which, once they are afoot, the New World can not escape. Duty and prudence alike command first that the germ-centers of hatred and revenge should be constantly and vigilantly served and treated in good time, and that an adequate organization should be set up to make sure that the pestilence can be controlled at its earliest beginnings, before it spreads and rages throughout the entire earth."\nSir Winston Churchill, Prime minister of the United Kingdom, 26/12/1941, US Congress, Washington, D.C., United States of America"

sp_eng_baldwin_the_english_secret_mi_desc:0 ""Let me end in this, the last speech I shall make before a great audience as Prime Minister of this country. Let me proclaim my faith, which is the faith of millions of all races from end to end of the British Empire. Here we have ceased to be an island, but we are still an Empire. And what is her secret? Freedom, ordered freedom, within the law, with force in the background and not in the foreground: a society in which authority and freedom are blended in due proportion, in which state and citizen are both ends and means. It is an empire organised for peace and for the free development of the individual in and through an infinite variety of voluntary associations. It neither deifies the state nor its rulers. The fruits of a free spirit of men do not grow in the garden of tyranny. It’s been well said that slavery is a weed that grows in every soil. As long as we have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, men will turn their faces towards us and draw their breath more freely. The association of the peoples of the Empire is rooted and their fellowship is rooted in this doctrine of the essential dignity of the individual human soul: that is the English secret, however feebly and faintly we have, at times and places, embraced and obeyed it."\nStanley Baldwin, Prime minister of the United Kingdom, 27/05/1937, United Kingdom"

Since that memorable coronation day 26 years ago, he has become to each one of us more than a king: a father of a great family. Through twenty-six troubled years, through a terrible war, through times of unrest and depression, he has been a sincere and devoted leader, a wise and unselfish ruler, a king who maintained through all the storms of the 20th century the unswerving trust and love of his people.

Certain of the affection of our admirable army which fights with a heroism worthy of its long military traditions against an enemy superior in numbers and weapons. Certain that by its magnificent resistance it has fulfilled our duties in regard to our allies. Confident of the support of the Veterans that I had the pride to command. Certain of the confidence of the whole people, I give to France the gift of my person to attenuate for its suffering. In these unhappy hours, I think of the unfortunate refugees who, in extreme distress, line our roads. I express to them my compassion and my concern. It is with a broken heart that I say to you today that it is necessary to cease the fighting. This evening I have addressed our enemy to ask if he is ready to search with us, between soldiers, after struggle and in honor, the means of putting an end to the hostilities. May all the French rally around the government over which I preside during these hardships and suppress their anguish so as to obey only to their faith in the destiny of the Fatherland."\nPhilippe Pétain, Chef de l'État français, 17/06/1940, Lycée Longchamps, Bordeaux, France"

sp_fra_appeal_of_22_june_desc:0 ""The French government, after having asked for an armistice, now knows the conditions dictated by the enemy. The result of these conditions would be the complete demobilisation of the French land, sea, and air forces, the surrender of our weapons and the total occupation of French territory. The French government would come under German and Italian tutelage. It may therefore be said that this armistice would not only be a capitulation, but that it would also reduce the country to slavery. Now, a great many Frenchmen refuse to accept either capitulation or slavery, for reasons which are called: honour, common sense, and the higher interests of the country. It is therefore necessary to group the largest possible French force wherever this can be done. Everything which can be collected by way of French military elements and potentialities for armaments production must be organised wherever such elements exist. I, General de Gaulle, am undertaking this national task here in England. I call upon all French servicemen of the land, sea, and air forces; I call upon French engineers and skilled armaments workers who are on British soil, or have the means of getting here, to come and join me. I call upon the leaders, together with all soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the French land, sea, and air forces, wherever they may now be, to get in touch with me. I call upon all Frenchmen who want to remain free to listen to my voice and follow me. Long live free France in honour and independence!"\nCharles de Gaulle, Chef des Forces Françaises Libres, 22/06/1940, BBC radio, London, United Kingdom"

No! We will not hide this deep and sacred emotion. These are minutes which go beyond each of our poor lives. Paris! Paris outraged! Paris broken! Paris martyred! But Paris liberated! Liberated by itself, liberated by its people with the help of the French armies, with the support and the help of all France, of the France that fights, of the only France, of the real France, of the eternal France! Well! Since the enemy which held Paris has capitulated into our hands, France returns to Paris, to her home. She returns bloody, but quite resolute. She returns there enlightened by the immense lesson, but more certain than ever of her duties and of her rights. I speak of her duties first, and I will sum them all up by saying that for now, it is a matter of the duties of war. The enemy is staggering, but he is not beaten yet. He remains on our soil. It will not even be enough that we have, with the help of our dear and admirable Allies, chased him from our home for us to consider ourselves satisfied after what has happened. We want to enter his territory as is fitting, as victors."\nCharles de Gaulle, Chef des Forces Françaises Libres, 25/08/1944, Hôtel de ville, Paris"

Finally, Mr. Roosevelt asks that assurances be given him that the German armed forces will not attack, and above all, not invade, the territory or possessions of the following independent nations. He then names as those to which he refers: Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iraq, the Arabias, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Iran. Answers I have first taken the trouble to ascertain from the states mentioned, firstly, whether they feel themselves threatened, and, what is most important, secondly, whether this inquiry by the American President was addressed to us at their suggestion or at least with their consent. The reply was in all cases negative, in some instances strongly so. It is true that there were certain ones among the states and nations mentioned, whom I could not question because they themselves – as for example, Syria – are at present not in possession of their freedom, but are under occupation by the military agents of democratic states and consequently deprived of their rights. Apart from this fact, however, all states bordering on Germany have received much more binding assurances and -particularly, more binding proposals than Mr. Roosevelt asked from me in his curious telegram."\nAdolf Hitler, Führer, 24/08/1939, Reichstag, Berlin, Germany"

Indeed, it could have an altogether different name. But only because it is an important point, that is, there 30 million tons of traffic can be cut off, including about 9 million of oil shipments.

And if I reduce production I reduce that income, no matter what wages are paid out. Members of the Reichstag: Within the past four years we have increased German production to an extraordinary degree in all branches. And the whole German nation benefits by this increase. For it there is a demand today for very many million tons of coal more than formerly, this is not for the purpose of superheating the houses of a few millionaires to a couple of thousand degrees, but rather because millions of our German countrymen are thus enabled to purchase more coal for themselves with their increased income. By giving employment to millions of German workers who had hitherto been idle, the National Socialist Revolution has brought about such a gigantic increase in German production. That rise in our total national income guarantees the market value of the goods produced. And only in such cases where we could not increase this production, owing to certain conditions that were beyond our control, there have been shortages from time to time; but these bear no proportion whatsoever to the general success of the National Socialist struggle. The four-year plan is the most striking manifestation of the systematic way in which our economic life is being conducted. In particular this plan will provide permanent employment in the internal circulation of our economic life for those masses of German labour that are now being released from the armament industry. One sign of the gigantic economic development which has taken place is that in many industries today it is quite difficult to find sufficient skilled workmen. I am thankful that this is so; because it will help to place the importance of the worker as a man and as a working force in its proper light; and also because in doing so--though there are other motives also--we have a chance of making the activities of the party and its unions better understood and thus securing stronger and more willing support."\nAdolf Hitler, Führer, 30/01/1937, Reichstag, Berlin, Germany"

We have ordered our Government to communicate to the Governments of the United States, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that our empire accepts the provisions of their joint declaration. To strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations as well as the security and well-being of our subjects is the solemn obligation which has been handed down by our imperial ancestors and which we lay close to the heart. Indeed, we declared war on America and Britain out of our sincere desire to insure Japan's self-preservation and the stabilization of East Asia, it being far from our thought either to infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark upon territorial aggrandizement. But now the war has lasted for nearly four years. Despite the best that has been done by everyone--the gallant fighting of our military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of out servants of the State and the devoted service of our 100,000,000 people--the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest. Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization. Such being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, nor to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the powers. We cannot but express the deepest sense of regret to our allied nations of East Asia, who have consistently cooperated with the Empire toward the emancipation of East Asia. The thought of those officers and men as well as others who have fallen in the fields of battle, those who died at their posts of duty, or those who met death [otherwise] and all their bereaved families, pains our heart night and day. The welfare of the wounded and the war sufferers and of those who lost their homes and livelihood is the object of our profound solicitude. The hardships and sufferings to which our nation is to be subjected hereafter will be certainly great. We are keenly aware of the inmost feelings of all of you, our subjects. However, it is according to the dictates of time and fate that we have resolved to pave the way for a grand peace for all the generations to come by enduring the |unavoidable| and suffering what is insufferable. Having been able to save and maintain the structure of the Imperial State, we are always with you, our good and loyal subjects, relying upon your sincerity and integrity. Beware most strictly of any outbursts of emotion that may engender needless complications, of any fraternal contention and strife that may create confusion, lead you astray and cause you to lose the confidence of the world. Let the entire nation continue as one family from generation to generation, ever firm in its faith of the imperishable ness of its divine land, and mindful of its heavy burden of responsibilities, and the long road before it. Unite your total strength to be devoted to the construction for the future. Cultivate the ways of rectitude, nobility of spirit, and work with resolution so that you may enhance the innate glory of the Imperial State and keep pace with the progress of the world.To our good and loyal subjects: After pondering deeply the general trends of the world and the actual conditions obtaining in our empire today, we have decided to effect a settlement of the present situation by resorting to an extraordinary measure. We have ordered our Government to communicate to the Governments of the United States, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that our empire accepts the provisions of their joint declaration. To strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations as well as the security and well-being of our subjects is the solemn obligation which has been handed down by our imperial ancestors and which we lay close to the heart. Indeed, we declared war on America and Britain out of our sincere desire to insure Japan's self-preservation and the stabilization of East Asia, it being far from our thought either to infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark upon territorial aggrandizement. But now the war has lasted for nearly four years. Despite the best that has been done by everyone--the gallant fighting of our military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of out servants of the State and the devoted service of our 100,000,000 people--the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest. Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization. Such being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, nor to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the powers. We cannot but express the deepest sense of regret to our allied nations of East Asia, who have consistently cooperated with the Empire toward the emancipation of East Asia. The thought of those officers and men as well as others who have fallen in the fields of battle, those who died at their posts of duty, or those who met death [otherwise] and all their bereaved families, pains our heart night and day. The welfare of the wounded and the war sufferers and of those who lost their homes and livelihood is the object of our profound solicitude. The hardships and sufferings to which our nation is to be subjected hereafter will be certainly great. We are keenly aware of the inmost feelings of all of you, our subjects. However, it is according to the dictates of time and fate that we have resolved to pave the way for a grand peace for all the generations to come by enduring the [unavoidable] and suffering what is insufferable. Having been able to save and maintain the structure of the Imperial State, we are always with you, our good and loyal subjects, relying upon your sincerity and integrity. Beware most strictly of any outbursts of emotion that may engender needless complications, of any fraternal contention and strife that may create confusion, lead you astray and cause you to lose the confidence of the world. Let the entire nation continue as one family from generation to generation, ever firm in its faith of the imperishable ness of its divine land, and mindful of its heavy burden of responsibilities, and the long road before it. Unite your total strength to be devoted to the construction for the future. Cultivate the ways of rectitude, nobility of spirit, and work with resolution so that you may enhance the innate glory of the Imperial State and keep pace with the progress of the world."\nHirohito, 124th Emperor of Japan, 14/08/1945"

sp_nzl_new_zealand_is_ready_desc:0 ""From the north across these peaceful waters comes a shadow: Japan. At last war really comes to New Zealand. Japan strikes without warning: west, east and south. Parliament assembles to discuss new grave dangers to our security. The war has been something very far away, intimate for us only because of the young men we have sent to it across the world's oceans. Now our own soil is threatened: we see for the first time the prospect of unfriendly feet attempting to despoil our land. What can we do? We have heavy batteries at our coastal defense positions. Over the outer waters we maintain a constant aerial patrol. Behind the patrolling squadrons are the lines of our bombers. Yes, those are our bombers. In our own waters watching our shipping lanes are the continuous patrolls of our men [sweeping fleet?]. Some have been built in our building by our own industry, some of the fleet have been converted from commercial vessels. Already one has been lost at the hazards of her task. Those round shapes in the water of our ports have already make this war seem more close to us. We think that Japan may have assisted the raiders that [layed?] the mines. Against air attacks, our cities are not so heavily guarded as the beleaguered towers of Britain. But neither are they so seriously menaced. We have anti-aircraft batteries and they are good. We have had great difficulties to overcome when organizing our defense, not the least of these the spaces of oceans separating us from our sources of supply. But this disadvantage is also our advantage. At the end of his journey to New Zealand, what would an enemy find? What if he survived the sea, the storms of our weather, and the fierce spirit of defense in our citizens? We would find that our military forces have been armed and trained so that adequate strength can be rushed at short notice to any point of danger. We have been making our own munitions as well as [lengthening?] our defense by importations. We have tanks, and heavy tanks they are too. Heavier by far than anything any enemy could land against the strength we should throw to meet him, and against our rage at his temerity in disturbing our New Zealand way of living. We have artillery for all purposes. Let it be admitted that New Zealand follows the ways of peace, while the Axis powers plan their [thrusts] and felonies. Let us admit that we are not as strong as nations which have planned for years how best to wage their war against the world, but we are no longer unwary or helpless against them. We have our resolution and our arms. We have fast and exceptionally mobile gun tractors and gun carriers: many of them made in our own factories by our own workmen. They are being used to [tour] these modern guns, the 25 pounders so successful in Libya and ready here for any aggressor too hasty in his greed. Our military forces are organized into lines of defense capable of cushioning and finally shaking off any blow that might be aimed against us. Everywhere in New Zealand battalions of the Home Guard, ordinary men in [rough and ready] cloths [arming] now with modern tools of war are making [the need] to help to take the first shock of attack in any district from sea to sea across the narrow islands in towns and villages overall our farm and mountain country. If he does come then we shall set the cost of disturbing into anger a people who fight for peace and not for [aggrandizement] of power. We have no cause to be too assured, but we are not without [weapons] of war. We have assembled much of the most modern equipment. We may not be Goliath but we have David's sling. Ready now at posts all through New Zealand, our men of the national military reserve since war began they have trained assiduously to fight from the sands by the sea to the hills behind us. Most of them are already [tried] in battle. All of them are waiting behind barbed wire sandbags, armed to shoot and to kill. Where armoured vehicles cannot easily travel to our countryside, so often rough and mountainous, we have horsemen, wild in their riding, reckless in their skill and tempestuous in their charge. Where troops can be deployed in numbers and with the mobility of modern warfare, we have our territorial army. No single man need march to meet an enemy. The people have given up their trucks, cars, motorcycles and petrol, so that our army can move far and fast and hit hard. We can quickly throw into battle anywhere at any time a substantial force of troops. They far exceed in number the total of any force any enemy could hope to bring across the sea unless all the rest of the decent world and our all ships from Britain and America were suddenly and impossibly gone from our support. And with our soldiers ready for that enemy are all our people, watching the sea and sky as sentries watch for danger from all quarters. We are standing behind the remparts of the seas around us and we are standing firm. If he comes across the sea, our enemy will find other barriers and if barbed wire and bullets failed to stop him and guns in all our many arms, then he will find us still determined. It is not for us to be ashamed of our efforts, nor overconfident. We need not be doubtful of our capacity or cocksure about our strength. We do our part when we know what we possess and when we understand how it must be improved. We do not shout our own praise, we do not [?] past failures. We are not too calm. We are confident, we have our hope for the future as a free nation of free people and we are dangerously angered that our earth and home should thus be menaced by an aggressor so advanced in the art of destruction and so reduced in the ideals of human progress. New Zealand is ready!"\nNational Film Unit, 21/12/1941"

I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more, or anything different, that I could have done, and that would have been more successful. Up to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland. But Hitler would not have it; he had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened. And although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement. The proposals were never shown to the Poles, nor to us. And though they were announced in the German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning. His action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today in fulfillment of our obligations going to the aid of Poland who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience, we have done all that any country could do to establish peace, but a situation in which no word given by Germany's ruler could be trusted, and no people or country could feel itself safe, had become intolerable.

I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more, or anything different, that I could have done, and that would have been more successful. Up to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland. But Hitler would not have it; he had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened. And although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement. The proposals were never shown to the Poles, nor to us. And though they were announced in the German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning. His action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today in fulfillment of our obligations going to the aid of Poland who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience, we have done all that any country could do to establish peace, but a situation in which no word given by Germany's ruler could be trusted, and no people or country could feel itself safe, had become intolerable. And now that we have resolved to finish it, I know that you will all play your parts with calmness and courage."\nNeville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, 03/09/1939, Cabinet Room, 10 Downing Street, London, United Kingdom"

At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.

The House will have read the historic declaration in which, at the desire of many Frenchmen, and of our own hearts, we have proclaimed our willingness to conclude at the darkest hour in French history a union of common citizenship. However matters may go in France or with the French Government or with another French Government, we in this island and in the British Empire will never lose our sense of comradeship with the French people. If we are now called upon to endure what they have suffered we shall emulate their courage, and if final victory rewards our toils they shall share the gains, aye. And freedom shall be restored to all. We abate nothing of our just demands—Czechs, Poles, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians, all who have joined their causes to our own shall be restored. What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilisation. Upon it depends our own British life and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him all Europe may be free, and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands; but if we fail then the whole world, including the United States, and all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister, and perhaps more prolonged, by the lights of a perverted science.

The result of these conditions would be the complete demobilisation of the French land, sea, and air forces, the surrender of our weapons and the total occupation of French territory. The French government would come under German and Italian tutelage. It may therefore be said that this armistice would not only be a capitulation, but that it would also reduce the country to slavery. Now, a great many Frenchmen refuse to accept either capitulation or slavery, for reasons which are called: honour, common sense, and the higher interests of the country. It is therefore necessary to group the largest possible French force wherever this can be done. Everything which can be collected by way of French military elements and potentialities for armaments production must be organised wherever such elements exist. I, General de Gaulle, am undertaking this national task here in England. I call upon all French servicemen of the land, sea, and air forces; I call upon French engineers and skilled armaments workers who are on British soil, or have the means of getting here, to come and join me.

We can repay the debt which we owe to our God, to our dead and to our children only by work--by ceaseless devotion to the responsibilities which lie ahead of us. If I could give you a single watchword for the coming months, that word is--work, work, and more work. We must work to finish the war. Our victory is but half-won. The West is free, but the East is still in bondage to the treacherous tyranny of the Japanese. When the last Japanese division has surrendered unconditionally, then only will our fighting be done. We must seek to bind up the wounds of a suffering world--to build an abiding peace, a peace rooted in justice and in law. We can build such a peace only by hard, toilsome, painstaking work--by understanding and working with our allies in peace as we have in war.

sp_listen_nzl_new_zealand_is_ready_desc:0 ""From the north across these peaceful waters comes a shadow: Japan. At last war really comes to New Zealand. Japan strikes without warning: west, east and south. Parliament assembles to discuss new grave dangers to our security. The war has been something very far away, intimate for us only because of the young men we have sent to it across the world's oceans. Now our own soil is threatened: we see for the first time the prospect of unfriendly feet attempting to despoil our land. What can we do? We have heavy batteries at our coastal defense positions. Over the outer waters we maintain a constant aerial patrol. Behind the patrolling squadrons are the lines of our bombers. Yes, those are our bombers. In our own waters watching our shipping lanes are the continuous patrolls of our men [sweeping fleet?]. Some have been built in our building by our own industry, some of the fleet have been converted from commercial vessels. Already one has been lost at the hazards of her task. Those round shapes in the water of our ports have already make this war seem more close to us. We think that Japan may have assisted the raiders that [layed?] the mines. Against air attacks, our cities are not so heavily guarded as the beleaguered towers of Britain. But neither are they so seriously menaced. We have anti-aircraft batteries and they are good. We have had great difficulties to overcome when organizing our defense, not the least of these the spaces of oceans separating us from our sources of supply. But this disadvantage is also our advantage. At the end of his journey to New Zealand, what would an enemy find? What if he survived the sea, the storms of our weather, and the fierce spirit of defense in our citizens? We would find that our military forces have been armed and trained so that adequate strength can be rushed at short notice to any point of danger. We have been making our own munitions as well as [lengthening?] our defense by importations. We have tanks, and heavy tanks they are too. Heavier by far than anything any enemy could land against the strength we should throw to meet him, and against our rage at his temerity in disturbing our New Zealand way of living. We have artillery for all purposes. Let it be admitted that New Zealand follows the ways of peace, while the Axis powers plan their [thrusts] and felonies. Let us admit that we are not as strong as nations which have planned for years how best to wage their war against the world, but we are no longer unwary or helpless against them. We have our resolution and our arms. We have fast and exceptionally mobile gun tractors and gun carriers: many of them made in our own factories by our own workmen. They are being used to [tour] these modern guns, the 25 pounders so successful in Libya and ready here for any aggressor too hasty in his greed. Our military forces are organized into lines of defense capable of cushioning and finally shaking off any blow that might be aimed against us. Everywhere in New Zealand battalions of the Home Guard, ordinary men in [rough and ready] cloths [arming] now with modern tools of war are making [the need] to help to take the first shock of attack in any district from sea to sea across the narrow islands in towns and villages overall our farm and mountain country. If he does come then we shall set the cost of disturbing into anger a people who fight for peace and not for [aggrandizement] of power. We have no cause to be too assured, but we are not without [weapons] of war. We have assembled much of the most modern equipment. We may not be Goliath but we have David's sling. Ready now at posts all through New Zealand, our men of the national military reserve since war began they have trained assiduously to fight from the sands by the sea to the hills behind us. Most of them are already [tried] in battle. All of them are waiting behind barbed wire sandbags, armed to shoot and to kill. Where armoured vehicles cannot easily travel to our countryside, so often rough and mountainous, we have horsemen, wild in their riding, reckless in their skill and tempestuous in their charge. Where troops can be deployed in numbers and with the mobility of modern warfare, we have our territorial army. No single man need march to meet an enemy. The people have given up their trucks, cars, motorcycles and petrol, so that our army can move far and fast and hit hard. We can quickly throw into battle anywhere at any time a substantial force of troops. They far exceed in number the total of any force any enemy could hope to bring across the sea unless all the rest of the decent world and our all ships from Britain and America were suddenly and impossibly gone from our support. And with our soldiers ready for that enemy are all our people, watching the sea and sky as sentries watch for danger from all quarters. We are standing behind the remparts of the seas around us and we are standing firm. If he comes across the sea, our enemy will find other barriers and if barbed wire and bullets failed to stop him and guns in all our many arms, then he will find us still determined. It is not for us to be ashamed of our efforts, nor overconfident. We need not be doubtful of our capacity or cocksure about our strength. We do our part when we know what we possess and when we understand how it must be improved. We do not shout our own praise, we do not [?] past failures. We are not too calm. We are confident, we have our hope for the future as a free nation of free people and we are dangerously angered that our earth and home should thus be menaced by an aggressor so advanced in the art of destruction and so reduced in the ideals of human progress. New Zealand is ready!"\nNational Film Unit, 21/12/1941"
